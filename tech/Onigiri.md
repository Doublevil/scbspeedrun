# Onigiri techs

## Collecting all onigiris

It's often much faster to collect all the onigiris in a stage in one go, rather than having to go through the stage multiple times. When dealing with cartridge-specific onigiris, however, you are theoretically restricted to a single cartridge, that often prevents you from collecting other onigiris further into the stage.

In these circumstances, we will often drop the cart-specific onigiri in a convenient location, collect the other one with different cartridges, and then come back to the onigiri we dropped to pick it back up.

## Juggling

We can take a cartridge-specific onigiri to seemingly unintended places by juggling them. This technique consists in using a double-jump, a dash or a cable jump, and then immediately swapping to the onigiri's cartridge to grab it while keeping the momentum of the jump/dash.

This is less ideal for, say, voltage onigiris with a double-jump setup, because you have to swap multiple times or use the very slow cartridge select menu. It also often requires some light backtracking, which means it isn't always the fastest option.

As a side note, we know that this mechanic is somewhat intended, or at least acknowledged by the game, because this is the only way to get the cable onigiri in FS2.

## SD storage juggling

We can take this juggling technique further by using SD storage. This is best done in a pure upwards movement, as you'll have to constantly go back and forth to grab back the onigiri.

The timing is deceptively precise. It's hard to master, even when you've already mastered SD storage.

## Multicart ending

We have discovered that it's possible to complete a level with multiple cartridge-specific onigiris at once (e.g. an ink onigiri and a cable onigiri).

This is best shown by the RF2 "All onigiri strat".

The technique consists in dropping a cart-specific onigiri near the goal, getting the second cart-specific onigiri, grabbing the goal while you're over the dropped onigiri, and then switching back to the first cartridge during the level complete animation. This makes you grab back the first onigiri instead of the second one, but for some reason, both will count as collected.
