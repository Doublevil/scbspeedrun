# Voltage cart techs

## Voltage flick

While using the voltage cart, you can instantly change direction by pressing the cartridge action button again while inputting the direction you want. This is what we call "voltage flick".

This allows us to optimize turns, especially while swimming in the pools in Firewall and Core, because it's faster than normal movement.

You can also use it in the boss fight against The Blacklister to clip into the soft wall on the left of the screen, which is useful for stabilizing while waiting for an attack to end, and to save a few frames by clipping a bit into the eye, which guarantees you'll hit it as soon as it starts opening.

## Pool boost

When exiting a pool, if you keep the cartridge action button pressed, you'll keep flying for a bit and then fall. However, as the game attempts to teach you in later Firewall levels, if the button isn't pressed while you exit the pool, you'll get a slight speed boost in whatever direction you were facing, and your voltage cart is regenerated, meaning you can use it again without having to touch a wall or the ground.

The boost you get from exiting the pool (let's call it a "pool boost") makes you move very slightly faster than the voltage ability for a short duration, before slowing down. So the best strat to optimize areas with lots of pools is to never hold the cartridge action button, and chain voltage dashes just as you start slowing down after the pool boost.

The boost accelerates you forward in the direction you are facing while exiting the pool, so you can use that to your advantage.

For example, when exiting a horizontal pool, you can input Up a bit just before exiting the pool, so you're boosted upwards, making you fly further. This can be useful to avoid falling into glitch blocks without having to burn cartridge abilities.

Similarly, pressing Down as you exit the pool will cut down the time it takes for Cable Boy to fall down to your destination.

For example, in Firewall > FW7, you can press Up when exiting the pools in the first section to consistently avoid crashing into the stairs-shaped glitch blocks.
