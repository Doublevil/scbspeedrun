# Manipulating the cable

As you probably know, to complete a level, Cable Boy's cable must connect to the plug. But this is also something that can be optimized. It's particularly important before CableCart, as you can't just hook to the plug from afar yet.

There are several ways to manipulate the cable, and essentially, what you can do depends on the level. They can only save you something like a third of a second, but it adds up, and it's generally free (doesn't lose any time to try).

Here are the two general techniques you can use.

## Swing jump

When dragging the cable behind you, jumping while holding forward will cause the cable to swing below Cable Boy, making a fully stretched semi-circle before losing momentum. You can use this to get the cable fully stretched to the right and thus have it reach the plug a bit earlier, in levels where the platforms and timing allows it.

## Geometry bounce

In some levels, the platform geometry near the end (gaps, walls, etc) allows you to move in a way that makes your cable bounce super fast and stretch towards the plug.

This technique doesn't work in many levels, isn't particularly reliable, and saves very little time, but it's still nice to know, because for the most part it will cost you no time to try it.
