# Jump cart techs

## Swap dash

At the end of a dash, there's a moment where your velocity is greatly reduced in a couple of frames, reverting back to normal speed.

Switching to another cartridge right before that moment prevents that, allowing you to carry dash speed a little bit further. This is the swap dash.

As demonstrated here, you can use it to reach higher, but it works in any direction. However, it's very precise. Missing the timing just a little bit means you get only a slight boost, or no boost at all.

## Swap dash storage (SD Storage)

Now, the swap dash also does something more surprising: it stores the remaining length of the dash and allows us to re-use the dash for that reduced duration.

To explain it further: think of the dash frames as fuel. In theory, the game allows you to dash as long as you still have some fuel left. However, usually when you dash, you use up all of your fuel because there's nothing to stop the dash. After the dash, you have no fuel left, so that's why you can't dash a second time. And then of course touching a wall or the ground refills your fuel entirely. Now, switching to another cart interrupts the dash, which stops fuel consumption. So then you're in the air, and you have some fuel left, which means you can dash again. If you manage to save some fuel in the second dash, you can even do a third one, then a fourth, etc. You just need to be quick enough to interrupt the dash as soon as possible.

We can exploit that to negate gravity and gain more height by quickly chaining swap dashes together. This is what SD Storage looks like:

This is a very hard technique to master, and while it looks impressive and allows us to do some eye-catching strats, it's almost always risky, and you have to keep in mind that, while it does save some time, it's not game-changing. You should consider only learning it when you are already doing solid runs and are looking to save a few more seconds.

The key to execute SD Storage is to switch to another cart as soon as possible after dashing, so that you burn as few dash frames as possible at every swap dash. When it's almost used up, you can get an additional speed boost by swap dashing during the last few frames of the dash, as explained in the Swap dash paragraph.

## Ink double jump

Combining the jump cart and ink cart, you can jump in the air, then immediately switch to ink and toggle it. This allows us to reach higher through ink obstacles, to execute some pretty creative strats.
