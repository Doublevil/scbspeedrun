# Jump cart techs

## Swap dash

At the end of a dash, there's a moment where your velocity is greatly reduced in a couple of frames, reverting back to normal speed.

Switching to another cartridge right before that moment prevents that, allowing you to carry dash speed a little bit further. This is the swap dash.

As demonstrated here, you can use it to reach higher. But it works in any direction. However, it's very precise. Missing the timing just a little bit means you get only a slight boost, or no boost at all.

The swap dash isn't required in any current strat, but using it well might save you some time.

## Ink double jump

Combining the jump cart and ink cart, you can jump in the air, then immediately switch to ink and toggle it. This allows us to reach higher through ink obstacles, to execute some pretty creative strats.
