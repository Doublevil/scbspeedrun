# Ink cart techs

## Ink wall clip

If you toggle the ink cartridge as you are at a position where an ink wall should be in the other dimension, you will clip into that wall and the game physics will try to eject you from the wall, theoretically in the direction of the nearest edge, sometimes at high speeds.

As you might have guessed, we can abuse this for several tricks.

### Extending jumps

When you clip into any ink wall in the correct way, you can trick the game into thinking you are grounded (walking on the ground) for a few frames. This is really useful because when you are grounded, not only do you get your dash, double jump and voltage back, you also get to jump from the ground (and coyote time means you don't have to be too precise in your inputs).

Another cool thing is that it also gives you a slight speed boost when you are ejected out of the wall, so it can be used to go faster in many ways.

### Zipping through walls

When the ink wall touches a non-ink, solid wall, you can sometimes use ink clipping to pass through the solid wall.

However, we haven't found any real use for this in speedrunning. So yeah, it's useless, but you can do it.

### Boosting

Again, for this purpose, the ink wall has to touch a solid wall. By pressing against the solid wall and toggling the ink wall, you will sometimes be boosted out of the ink wall at high speed. And we like speed.

However, apart from LCD2, we have not been able to find any level where this could be used for speedrunning.
