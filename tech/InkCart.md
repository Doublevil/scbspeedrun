# Ink cart techs

## Ink wall clip

If you toggle the ink cartridge as you are at a position where an ink wall should be in the other dimension, you will clip into that wall and the game physics will try to eject you from the wall, theoretically in the direction of the nearest edge, sometimes at high speeds.

As you might have guessed, we can abuse this for several tricks.

### Extending jumps

When you clip into any ink wall in the correct way, you can trick the game into thinking you are grounded (walking on the ground) for a few frames. This is really useful because when you are grounded, not only do you get your dash, double jump and voltage back, you also get to jump from the ground (and coyote time means you don't have to be too precise in your inputs).

Another cool thing is that it also gives you a slight speed boost when you are ejected out of the wall, so it can be used to go faster in many ways.

### Zipping through walls

When the ink wall touches a non-ink, solid wall, you can sometimes use ink clipping to pass through the solid wall.

However, we haven't found any real use for this in speedrunning. So yeah, it's useless, but you can do it.

### Boosting

For boosting, the ink wall has to be connected to a solid surface, either on the bottom to the ground, or on the right side to a wall.

Wall clipping from these setups will sometimes boost you out of the ink wall at high speed. Which is good, because we happen to like speed.

In any case, this will always send you flying up and slightly to the left. There is no way that we know of that you're going to be boosted in any other direction.

These boosts are inconsistent because your positioning needs to be very precise, so you might be better off avoiding them, but there's no denying that they are fast.

#### Boosting against a wall

When using a wall like that, you have to press Right against the wall while toggling the ink ability in order to get the boost.

#### Boosting against the ground

When the ink wall is connected to the ground, you have to position yourself almost centered, but very slightly to the left of the ink wall when toggling the ink ability.
