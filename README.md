# Super Cable Boy Speedrun Guide

This guide aims to provide you with every strat that's used to speedrun the game **Super Cable Boy**.

**IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

You are welcome to join our community on Discord. Don't hesitate to ask questions there if you have any.

## Getting started

If you're looking to get started in Super Cable Boy speedrunning (welcome!), here are some thoughts:
- In the settings menu, you will find that you can enable the timer, and turn off screen shaking. It is also advised to turn on simplified graphics, to have a clearer view of what's going on.
- The timer starts when entering the map on a new game and ends when the loading bar is complete after the final boss.
- To get a general idea of how a run goes, the best thing to do is to watch one of our registered records on speedrun.com.
- As it is often the case in speedrunning in general, practicing the harder levels first is the best way to improve your time when you're starting. If you don't know where to start, practice the Core levels.
- Your run doesn't need to be perfect! You are expected to die a few times in your run, so don't worry too much about it, just have fun and enjoy the satisfaction of improving your time as you're getting better and better.

## General speedrunning techs

This section contains links to individual pages detailing speedrunning techniques and general knowledge that is not tied to a particular level and that we use throughout the run.

## Level-by-level strats collection

In this section, you will find links to individual pages that each describe the different strats that speedrunners use to complete a level.

### Quick note about the format

The format of every page will always follow the same structure:
- Title of the level
- Notes about the level (if any)
- An individual panel for each strat, separated with a horizontal bar, each containing:
    - Name of the strat
    - Approximate time of level completion when the strat is done right (without transitions)
    - Estimated difficulty of the strat, as a 5-star rating, ★☆☆☆☆ being the easiest and ★★★★★ the hardest
    - A collapsible panel (by default only the fastest strat is expanded) containing a video of the strat being executed, and optional notes
