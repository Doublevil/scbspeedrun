  **Notes**
  - This strat uses the Metaphor zip tech. See the movement techs page for more info.
  - We also use the wall plug tech in a specific way. Learn more about wall plug in the cable cart techs page.
  - The wall plug needs to be done in a certain way, because the cable has to be long enough to reach out to the plug through the ceiling. Jump from the last "1" spot at the bottom of the messagebox, then hold Right and grab when you touch the ceiling, then quickly switch to jump cart and dash while still holding Right.
  - It's pretty hard to get the wall plug, especially since we cannot see where we grab. With a little bit of training though, it should still save time even if you fail it once or twice.
  - Once you are in position, focus on the sequence of inputs, not on the visual. You might find it easier if you hold still for a bit to focus before doing the wall plug.

## Speedhack onigiri metaphor zip strat

`Time` **00:08.550** `Difficulty` ★★★☆☆

  <summary>Click to show/hide the strat</summary>

  [![Strat animation](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/CORE/CORE0_S_OnigiriMetaphorZip.webp)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/CORE/CORE0_S_OnigiriMetaphorZip.mp4?raw=true)

  **Notes**
  - This strat uses the Metaphor zip tech. See the movement techs page for more info.
  - Metaphor zip is harder with speedhack because of the wall running mechanics. To make it consistent, we use the voltage cart only after a long jump, so that we are as close as possible to the corner when switching to jump cart. This way, we can dash into the corner and immediately jump through the wall.
  - Then, we also use the wall plug tech in a specific way. Learn more about wall plug in the cable cart techs page.
  - The wall plug needs to be done in a certain way, because the cable has to be long enough to reach out to the plug through the ceiling. Jump from the last "1" spot at the bottom of the messagebox, then hold Right and grab when you touch the ceiling, then quickly switch to jump cart and dash while still holding Right.
