# All strats > The Core > CORE8

[< Back (CORE7)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/levels/all_lvl/CORE/CORE7.md) | [Next (CORE9) >](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/levels/all_lvl/CORE/CORE9.md)

**Notes**
- Because the Core levels are so long and quite difficult, and also are the end of the run, you generally should try to reduce risk instead of optimizing speed. On these levels, trying to save 3 seconds can quickly end up costing you 30 seconds and killing your run.

  **Notes**
  - Very risky as a whole, but you can use only parts of the strat to improve your time a little bit.
  - Using the jump cart in the middle section allows us to skip having to go up and hug some wall to refresh the voltage cart. It shouldn't be too risky as long as you use the dash early.

  **Notes**
  - The onigiri part is a bit scary because you have to avoid the glitchy ink to the left, without touching the rightmost glitch crumble. However, doing it normally would still be scary (maybe even more) on top of being slow.
  - Going directly from the onigiri section to the voltage pool is even scarier, and is the reason why we switch to triple jump and make a jump. This lets us reset our vertical speed and get closer to the pool before toggling the voltage cart. Without that jump, voltage would expire just before we reach the pool.
  - It's way safer to voltage to the rightmost messagebox wall before going for the voltage pool. Keep in mind that dying there costs 20 seconds.
  - For the rest of the level, you can also play it safer. See the safe strat in the Any% route.
