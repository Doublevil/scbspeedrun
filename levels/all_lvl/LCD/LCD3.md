  **Notes**
  - You should memorize the transition with the previous level and remember you have to jump right at the start, otherwise you're definitely going to hold right and run straight into the glitch blocks.

## Speedhack double onigiri strat

`Time` **00:13.300** `Difficulty` ★★★☆☆
<details>
  <summary>Click to show/hide the strat</summary>

  [![Strat animation](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/LCD/LCD3_S_DoubleOnigiri.webp)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/LCD/LCD3_S_DoubleOnigiri.mp4?raw=true)

  **Notes**
  - The hard part of this strat is getting out of the maze after picking up the jump onigiri.
  - We do it here with only a jump at the end, so that we can dash down and gain some time over just waiting to fall down. This is dangerous, it's way safer to use a dash first, and then jump over the last glitchy ink wall.
  - In order to be able to keep your dash like shown on the video, you have to do two things.
  - 1. Just after picking up the onigiri, on your entry into the maze, you have to double-jump with as much horizontal speed as possible. To do that, run until the entry, but then stop running. This will stop your momentum so that you don't bump into the glitchy ink after jumping. Start holding Right at the top of your jump, then double-jump.
  - 2. On the horizontal section, before the battery, dash forward as soon as possible. Then, after picking up the battery, double-jump when you're about to touch the glitchy ink on the bottom. You might need to stop holding right for a few frames so that you don't collide with the corner of the last glitchy ink wall.

  **Notes**
  - In the glitch maze after picking up the jump onigiri, you can let go of Right briefly to get around the corners more consistently.
