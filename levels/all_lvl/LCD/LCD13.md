  **Notes**
  - This strat uses a Wall Plug. Learn more in the Cable Cart techs page.
  - The platforming part is a bit tricky and involves a pretty precise ink double jump.
  - The wall plug part is not an easy one either and may fail if your timing or grabbing point isn't ideal.
  - To make the wall plug work, grab right under it, then dash upwards immediately, before the cable shrinks (make sure you haven't used up your dash before!)

  **Notes**
  - This is barely faster than the other strat, which is considerably easier. Only do this one if you are feeling crazy.

## Speedhack jailbreak wall plug strat

`Time` **00:06.600** `Difficulty` ★★★★☆

  <summary>Click to show/hide the strat</summary>

  [![Strat animation](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/LCD/LCD13_S_JailbreakWallPlug.webp)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/LCD/LCD13_S_JailbreakWallPlug.mp4?raw=true)

  **Notes**
  - This strat uses the wall plug tech. See the Cable cart techs page for more info.
  - You have to position the onigiri as high as possible, which is why we jump so late before running up the glitchy ink wall.
  - The wall plug is a complex one, because the goal is pretty far away from the wall. This means we have to extend the cable somehow. We do that by grabbing the ceiling as early as possible. Then, we exploit the vertical momentum of the speedhack wall run to push the cable further up and reach the goal before it shrinks down, while switching back to ink cart to grab the onigiri back.
  - This strat definitely takes some training to get consistently, and it might seem impossible at first, but it can absolutely be consistent once you get how it works.

  **Notes**
  - This is barely faster than the other strat, which is considerably easier. Only do this one if you are feeling crazy.
  - If you hesitate or lose any time anywhere, the other strat is faster.

## Strat

`Time` **00:07.000** `Difficulty` ★★☆☆☆

  <summary>Click to show/hide the strat</summary>

  [![Strat animation](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/LCD/LCD13_Strat.webp)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/LCD/LCD13_Strat.mp4?raw=true)

  **Notes**
  - Despite being very fast, it's probably the easiest way to do this level fast. It might take a bit of practice to chain all this together, but it's very consistent.
  - The low dash at the end might seem scary but it's actually safer than making a full jump, as you're falling more slowly. It's still faster than a full jump too.
  - Especially with speedhack, you'll have to remember to quickly toggle the ink cart at the start.

## Speedhack jailbreak intended strat

`Time` **00:08.600** `Difficulty` ★★☆☆☆

  <summary>Click to show/hide the strat</summary>

  [![Strat animation](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/LCD/LCD13_S_JailbreakIntended.webp)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/LCD/LCD13_S_JailbreakIntended.mp4?raw=true)

  **Notes**
  - Be careful on the jump from the top of the wall, that's an edge coyote. We first detach, then a bit later press Jump. Don't jump too late either, because you don't want to land on top of the glitch block, but on its side.
  - If you can't get the edge coyote consistently, land on top of the huge wall and jump from there.

## Onigiri strat

  **Notes**
  - You can rest on the alt-ink platform instead of jump-inking in the middle section, it shouldn't cost too much time.

## Jailbreak wall plug strat

  [![Strat animation](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/LCD/LCD13_JailbreakNullStrat.webp)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/LCD/LCD13_JailbreakNullStrat.mp4?raw=true)

  **Notes**
  - This strat uses the wall plug tech, with the null cart to extend the cable. See the Cable cart techs page for more info.
  - The hard part is positioning the onigiri as close as possible to the ceiling without touching it. It's really hard to chain everything together in this way.
