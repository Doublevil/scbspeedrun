  **Notes**
  - Yes, this counts as a win.
  - Grabbing the exit plug through the ink glitch blocks here just barely works, you have to grab at the last possible moment and be vertically aligned with the plug.
  - Even though it's technically faster, this strat is not very consistent and mostly here for fun. Go for the other strat.

  **Notes**
  - Be careful not to go too fast with the wall dashes on the first wall segment, or you'll crash into the glitch blocks in the gap between the two walls.
