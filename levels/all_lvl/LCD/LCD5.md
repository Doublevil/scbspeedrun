  **Notes**
  - Yes, this counts as a win.
  - Grabbing the exit plug through the ink glitch blocks here just barely works, you have to grab at the last possible moment and be vertically aligned with the plug.
  - Even though it's technically faster, this strat is not very consistent and mostly here for fun. Go for the other strat.

  **Notes**
  - Be careful not to go too fast with the wall dashes on the first wall segment, or you'll crash into the glitch blocks in the gap between the two walls.

## Speedhack onigiri risky strat

  **Notes**
  - It's possible to make it consistent with training, but this is really hard and does not save much. It does look cool though.
  - Check out the other strat instead.

## Speedhack onigiri safer strat

`Time` **00:08.800** `Difficulty` ★★★★☆

  <summary>Click to show/hide the strat</summary>

  [![Strat animation](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/LCD/LCD5_S_Onigiri.webp)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/LCD/LCD5_S_Onigiri.mp4?raw=true)

  **Notes**
  - Speedhack makes things harder on this one.
  - First, squeezing into the onigiri labyrinth is harder when you run up the ink walls. You have to cancel your jump. There's a rhythm to it that makes it consistent.
  - Second, it's harder to execute precise movement near the glitch blocks after picking up the onigiri. This strat demonstrates touching the left ink wall of the labyrinth and then going all the way back to the start to run on the ink ground at top speed.
  - The cool thing is that a single jump with speedhack ground speed allows us to exit the labyrinth and land directly on the other side of the glitchy ink wall near the goal.

## Onigiri strat

  **Notes**
  - That setup to slip into the ink maze should be pretty consistent.
  - Exiting through the gap in this way takes some practice. Don't hesitate to use a straight dash and stabilize on the ink instead.
