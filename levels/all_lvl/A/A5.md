  **Notes**
  - Definitely a precise stage. There are lots of platforms and obstacles everywhere. Lots of things can make you lose some time.
  - The key with the speedhack here is to maximize your time running on the ground. Dashing down to the platforms helps with that.

  **Notes**
  - A very optimization-heavy stage - be careful not to jump too high or too low, but you can adjust in a variety of ways if your position isn't exactly right.
  - Clearing that first section without touching the ground saves you some time because it means you fall faster on the right side.

  **Notes**
  - A very optimization-heavy stage - be careful not to jump too high or too low, but you can adjust in a variety of ways if your position isn't exactly right.
  - Clearing that first section without touching the ground saves you some time because it means you fall faster on the right side.
  - Don't try to improvise your way out of the onigiri, you'll take an unoptimized route at best and maybe even trip over some glitch blocks. Fall back to the Any% strat path.
