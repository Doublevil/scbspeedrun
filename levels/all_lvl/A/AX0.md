  **Notes**
  - This is extremely precise. It requires a very good aim with voltage, and is almost impossible with the D-pad.
  - The first voltage dash must be started at the first frame and aimed slightly down in order to touch the ground as soon as possible and right in front of the first piston.
  - The second voltage dash must be started right after touching the ground and aimed slightly up so that you can use voltage without jumping before. You must then go in a relative straight line towards the second piston, as close as the ground as possible, but without touching the ground.
  - The piston crushing you while in voltage will actually boost you to the right instead (most of the time).
  - It's always possible to fallback to the normal voltage strat if you miss it (unless you get crushed).
  - Immediately trying it again and getting it on the second try will still save time over the normal voltage strat. But can you really get it on the second try?

## Voltage strat

`Time` **00:09.700** `Difficulty` ★☆☆☆☆

  **Notes**
  - Unless you go for the cycle skip and get it, you'll have to wait for the pistons to come up.
  - Dancing at the start is not mandatory but is highly encouraged.
