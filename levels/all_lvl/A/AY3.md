  **Notes**
  - Requires a lot of practice to master, but saves a good deal of time.
  - The semi-cycle skip strat might be a good compromise if you're used to it or if you get it more consistently, but it doesn't really seem that this one is harder.

  **Notes**
  - Based on the full cycle skip strat from the Any% route.
  - In addition to the difficulty of the original strat, you have to jump high enough to go over the glitch barrage, but low enough to get the onigiri. This is best done by doing two things.
  - After clearing the first moving platform, when you are hooked to the plug, jump early and without pressing Up or Down. This will allow you to align with the second moving platform for the second tricky jump.
  - The second tricky jump requires grabbing the second moving platform and doing a high jump from there (jumping while pressing Up). In order to get the right height and get the onigiri, you should grab the platform just past the point where you fall below it.

## Semi cycle skip strat

  **Notes**
  - Requires a lot of practice to master.
  - One of the keys to master it is to grab the second platform before it gets too close, which makes the jump from that platform much more lenient, as overshooting it won't crash you into the last glitch block.
  - You might find that holding right just a little bit before the first platform reaches the glitch blocks gives you the right timing to keep going without hitting glitch blocks and to grab the second platform with the right timing.
