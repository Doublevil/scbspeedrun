  **Notes**
  - Skipping the first piston cycle here is very, very tight. You have to dash right at the start and then combine dash and voltage to make it through.
  - Sometimes, you'll still get crushed by the pistons, but you might also get a boost.
  - If you fail this one, you can try to go for the second cycle skip and end up with a similar time.
  - Skipping the next cycle (the pistons on the top section) is definitely possible for a TAS, but it seems almost impossible for a human.

## Voltage second cycle skip strat

  **Notes**
  - Skipping the second piston cycle is also very tight. You pretty much have to regen your dash on piston on the right to get enough speed to make it.
