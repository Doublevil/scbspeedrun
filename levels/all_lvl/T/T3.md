  **Notes**
  - Before the last jump over the two glitch blocks, make sure you wait a few frames on the wall or you might not have enough height to fly over the glitch blocks.
  - We also found you can save a few frames by jumping over the two glitch blocks on the left with a quick wall jump instead of jumping to the opposite wall, but it's a bit too risky for what you gain.

  **Notes**
  - This strat uses an edge coyote (coyote timed wall jump) to grab the onigiri without falling down.
  - The long jump from the left crumbling wall into the onigiri pit is a bit scary, but definitely saves a bit of time compared to cutting it in several jumps. If you are having trouble with this jump, make sure you let go of the wall (press Right) for a couple of frames BEFORE jumping. And don't jump from too far up, or you'll fall too fast.
