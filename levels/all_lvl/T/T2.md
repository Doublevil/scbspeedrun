  **Notes**
  - The corner boosts on the crumbling platforms outside the tower save over a second and are pretty consistent (at least the first one).

## Jailbreak onigiri strat

  **Notes**
  - Lots of relatively precise movement here.
  - Near the end, in the vertical section with the crumbling platforms, the way we do it is with a neutral dash. Stop pressing Right, and when Cable Boy starts his falling animation, just press the cart action button to dash straight up. This should make you reach above the wall without touching the non-glitch blocks.

## Onigiri strat

  **Notes**
  - There are several optimizations here, but you can easily tweak the strat to something you're more comfortable with.
  - We only use the right crumbling block path to get the onigiri, which is normally intended as an exit only. The left path is slower.
  - After landing on the lowest crumbling block, you can reach the onigiri platform with one coyote jump as demonstrated here. It's way safer and only a little bit slower to do 2 jumps here.
