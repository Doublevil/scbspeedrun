  **Notes**
  - This one is all about timing.
  - The first timing to master is the first laser cycle. If you get the onigiri right away like in the strat, wait a bit before jumping up.
  - That jump up is a bit tight. You need to start jumping when you're almost walking on the glitch, otherwise you'll hit the glitch on the top.
  - The dash in between lasers shouldn't be too hard with a bit of training, and the timing is very lenient for this.
  - The last timing to master is the horizontal laser cycle. If you make it to the same cycle as the strat, just note that it will stop firing the moment the rotating laser behind you hits the block you're waiting on.
  - There is some leniency to this part, you don't have to perfectly play into the laser timing, but it's still pretty tight.

  **Notes**
  - If you miss any laser cycle, you'll have to improvise or die. When missing early on, you're probably better off hitting a glitch to reset everything, rather than try to improvise with the cycles and probably die anyways.
  - We use ink clipping in the rotating laser part, but it's not required, you can take it slower without any penalty, because you have to wait for the rotating lasers anyways.
  - About the horizontal laser cycle timing: if you make it to the same cycle as the strat, note that it will stop firing the moment the rotating laser behind you hits the block you're waiting on. For the ink strat though, it's very lenient, you don't have to rush it.
