  **Notes**
  - The dash in between lasers takes some training to master, but it's not that precise.

## Speedhack jump onigiri semi-cycle skip strat

  **Notes**
  - This is a small improvement over the jump onigiri basic strat. See the notes on that one for more info.
  - The only improvement is going into the horizontal laser section earlier, and waiting the cycle after the ink block in the middle, rather than before the whole section.
  - Because this one is harder to master and only a very minor time save, it's highly recommended to go for the simpler one.
  - In the horizontal laser section, the strat toggles ink only after the onigiri crosses the ink block, but because that timing is extremely tight, it's recommended to toggle ink right after you pass the ink block instead. You'll have to backtrack a bit to pick up the onigiri, but it's better than dying.

## Speedhack jump onigiri basic strat

  [![Strat animation](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/RF/RF0_S_JumpOnigiri.webp)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/RF/RF0_S_JumpOnigiri.mp4?raw=true)

  **Notes**
  - This one is all about timing.
  - The first timing to master is the first laser cycle. If you get the onigiri right away like in the strat, wait a bit before jumping up.
  - That jump up is a bit tight. You need to start jumping when you're almost walking on the glitch, otherwise you'll hit the glitch on the top.
  - The dash in between lasers shouldn't be too hard with a bit of training, and the timing is very lenient for this.
  - The last timing to master is the horizontal laser cycle. If you make it to the same cycle as the strat, just note that it will stop firing the moment the rotating laser behind you hits the block you're waiting on.
  - This last part is pretty lenient with speedhack. You don't have to perfectly play into the laser timing.

## Speedhack ink onigiri strat

`Time` **00:14.300** `Difficulty` ★★★★☆

  [![Strat animation](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/RF/RF0_S_InkOnigiri.webp)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/RF/RF0_S_InkOnigiri.mp4?raw=true)

  **Notes**
  - If you miss any laser cycle, you'll have to improvise or die. When missing early on, you're probably better off hitting a glitch to reset everything, rather than try to improvise with the cycles and probably die anyways.
  - At the start, it's easier to line up for voltage cart after doing a neutral jump, because the speedhack would make us run into the glitch block to the left otherwise.
  - About the horizontal laser cycle timing: if you make it to the same cycle as the strat, note that it will stop firing the moment the rotating laser behind you hits the block you're waiting on. It's very lenient though, especially with speedhack. You don't have to rush it.

## Ink onigiri strat

  **Notes**
  - If you miss any laser cycle, you'll have to improvise or die. When missing early on, you're probably better off hitting a glitch to reset everything, rather than try to improvise with the cycles and probably die anyways.
  - We use ink clipping in the rotating laser part, but it's not required, you can take it slower without any penalty, because you have to wait for the rotating lasers anyways.
  - About the horizontal laser cycle timing: if you make it to the same cycle as the strat, note that it will stop firing the moment the rotating laser behind you hits the block you're waiting on. For the ink strat though, it's very lenient, you don't have to rush it.
