  **Notes**
  - Probably the hardest onigiri in terms of death count. But fortunately, the only hard part comes first.
  - The most reliable way we have found to make it past that gap is to use the cable cart to grab the wall at a very precise point (almost pixel perfect) so that the cable extends just enough to be able to lean forward to the other side, so that a cable jump will barely take us to the other side.
  - You will die a lot in there, and it's okay. It's pretty fast anyways.
  - If you find yourself just short of making it under the blocks, you can try to wiggle the cable. Sometimes it will get you under there.
  - Once we're past, we perform an optional Metaphor zip (see movement techs) as a minor time save. You can go around instead.
  - Hold Down and Right in the crumbling blocks section to make sure you grab the bottom-most one.

## Onigiri strat

  **Notes**
  - We start with a cable jump onigiri juggle to grab the onigiri while skipping a few wall jumps.
  - In the next part, calibrating your wall jump to clear the gap without touching the top or bottom glitch blocks is the hardest part of the level. Train a bit on this until you get a hang of it. It's advised to spend a bit of time calibrating your height there before making the jump, that will cost you less time than dying.
  - In this same part, we skip one of the two walls. It's not advised, because it's way harder and doesn't save that much time.
  - On the crumble block part, use 2 full-height wall jumps before jumping to the first pillar. This should always make you reach a position where you clear blocks 4 and 5 at the same time. Try to do the same with the second pillar.
  - On the second crumble pillar, don't hold Right after touching the blocks, or you will risk entering a tiny 1 block gap just as it clears and miss your next jump because of it. Wall jump until a 2-block space clears out, and then go for it.
  - The last part is scary but it's just a coyote jump, it shouldn't be too hard. Alternatively, if you want to play it safe, you can use a cable jump juggle.
  - After the coyote jump in the end, if your cable is long enough, it should plug into the goal by itself. This is possible because null cart keeps cable length.
