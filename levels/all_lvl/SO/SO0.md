  **Notes**
  - If you're not comfortable with the tight turns and going through the shortcut, go for the safe strat instead.

  **Notes**
  - Easier but slower than the normal voltage strat.

## Onigiri strat

  **Notes**
  - On the first part, we start by waiting on our wall jumps, which allows us to clear the obstacles without hitting anything. This one two, one two three setup should be consistent, as long as you wait to reach max height before each wall jump.
  - In the middle section, we just cheat our way through by juggling the onigiri with a cable jump (cable jumping and immediately switching back to null cart to pick the onigiri back up). It's way easier to execute than the intended path, and saves a lot of time.
  - That last jump can be a killer, but if your cable is long enough, as it should be after the juggle, it should grab onto the goal before you touch the ground anyways. If you're not confident, you can do another cable jump juggle here instead of jumping normally.

  **Notes**
  - You don't have to actually go through the level.
  - There's a lot of tech in there, but past the first part, you're pretty much safe. So this might be a good option if you don't feel confident enough to go through the whole level with the null cart.
  - First off, we start by waiting on our wall jumps, which allows us to clear the obstacles without hitting anything. This one two, one two three setup should be consistent, as long as you wait to reach max height before each wall jump.
  - Next, we slide down the tower and perform an edge coyote. See the movement strats page for more info. Make sure to press Right for a few frames before going back Left after you start free falling.
  - Then, we juggle the onigiri with a cable jump. Just grab the wall with the cable cart, high jump, and immediately switch back to null cart to grab the onigiri back.
  - Next, we juggle it with both a double-jump and a cable jump to reach that little platform.
  - Finally, we perform a wall plug (see the cable strats page for more info) to grab the goal through the roof. This is just to save some time over going around.
