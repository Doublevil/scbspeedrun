  **Notes**
  - If you're not comfortable with the tight turns and going through the shortcut, go for the safe strat instead.

  **Notes**
  - Easier but slower than the normal voltage strat.

## Speedhack onigiri strat

  **Notes**
  - On the first part, we run up the first wall and detach without jumping, then run up but this time perform a wall jump for the second one.
  - After reaching the first crumbling block, you can run up the walls (just hold Left and Up) for the two sprite block towers, but then for the crumbling block, you'll have to stop running up, and do a normal wall jump from low enough on the block that you don't bump into the glitch blocks above. If you grab the crumbling block too high, wait a bit before wall jumping.
  - In the middle section, we just cheat our way through by juggling the onigiri with a cable jump (cable jumping and immediately switching back to null cart to pick the onigiri back up). It's way easier to execute than the intended path, and saves a lot of time.
  - With speedhack, the last jump can be tricky, because it's easy to run so fast that you end up on the glitch blocks before jumping. Keep in mind that you have to jump early! If you want to take it safer, you can do another cable jump juggle here instead of a normal jump.

## Speedhack onigiri cheaty strat

  [![Strat animation](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/SO/SO0_S_OnigiriReverse.webp)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/SO/SO0_S_OnigiriReverse.mp4?raw=true)

  **Notes**
  - An alternative, unintended onigiri route to the goal.
  - With speedhack, it can be almost as fast as the regular strat, but it's also way harder.
  - Go for the regular strat, this one is not worth it, even if you play it safer.
  - Going under the tower with the onigiri requires the use of either an edge coyote as shown in the strat, or a cable jump juggle, which would be slower but safer.
  - We use another variant of edge coyote 2 times to jump over the glitch blocks on the wall super fast and without switching out of null cart (run up the wall, detach, wait a bit, then jump in the air).
  - The jump and juggle that takes us under the goal is pretty tough to execute, you'll mostly end up bumping into the glitch blocks on the ceiling. You have to run up the wall for only a few frames, then hold Left. Don't switch to jump cart too early, or you won't be able to grab the wall under the goal.
  - Once we are under the goal, we use wall plug (see the cable strats page for more info) to grab the goal through the ceiling.

## Onigiri strat

`Time` **00:14.700** `Difficulty` ★★★★☆
<details>
  <summary>Click to show/hide the strat</summary>

  [![Strat animation](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/SO/SO0_OnigiriStrat.webp)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/SO/SO0_OnigiriStrat.mp4?raw=true)

  **Notes**
  - On the first part, we start by waiting on our wall jumps, which allows us to clear the obstacles without hitting anything. This one two, one two three setup should be consistent, as long as you wait to reach max height before each wall jump.
  - In the middle section, we just cheat our way through by juggling the onigiri with a cable jump (cable jumping and immediately switching back to null cart to pick the onigiri back up). It's way easier to execute than the intended path, and saves a lot of time.
  - That last jump can be a killer, but if your cable is long enough, as it should be after the juggle, it should grab onto the goal before you touch the ground anyways. If you're not confident, you can do another cable jump juggle here instead of jumping normally.

## Onigiri cheaty strat

  [![Strat animation](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/SO/SO0_OnigiriCheatStrat.webp)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/media/levels/SO/SO0_OnigiriCheatStrat.mp4?raw=true)

  **Notes**
  - You don't have to actually go through the level.
  - There's a lot of tech in there, but past the first part, you're pretty much safe. So this might be a good option if you don't feel confident enough to go through the whole level with the null cart.
  - First off, we start by waiting on our wall jumps, which allows us to clear the obstacles without hitting anything. This one two, one two three setup should be consistent, as long as you wait to reach max height before each wall jump.
  - Next, we slide down the tower and perform an edge coyote. See the movement strats page for more info. Make sure to press Right for a few frames before going back Left after you start free falling.
  - Then, we juggle the onigiri with a cable jump. Just grab the wall with the cable cart, high jump, and immediately switch back to null cart to grab the onigiri back.
  - Next, we juggle it with both a double-jump and a cable jump to reach that little platform.
  - Finally, we perform a wall plug (see the cable strats page for more info) to grab the goal through the roof. This is just to save some time over going around.
