  **Notes**
  - There's not much we can do here in term of strats. This is the intended way of getting the onigiri, and it's a very hard one.
  - Optimizing the wall jumps is a big part if you want to go fast, but focus on just consistently clearing the level first.
  - The strat here starts with a 2-3 strat, where the third wall jump on the right wall is quickly cancelled to make it perfectly where we need to be to get the jump over the glitch.
  - For the next vertical section, you can take it any way you want, but the most optimal way to do it is to position ourselves just under the glitch blocks on the wall to the right, so that we can make it to the platform with 3 single wall jumps.
  - Now for the hardest part of the level, the wall jump on the single wall block. It has to be done in a precise way, or you won't get enough speed to close the gap. Wall jumping during the jump rather than while falling after the jump is not only faster but also easier. You need to touch the wall block just under the glitch by lightly tapping Left, then start holding Right, and after a few frames, press Jump. If you press Jump early, you won't make it.
  - Download the video and do a frame-by-frame on the hard parts if you have difficulties with this one. And practice a lot.
