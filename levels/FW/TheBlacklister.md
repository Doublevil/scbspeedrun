**Notes**
- This is a boss fight. The Blacklister is a big eye with glitchy tentacles and wants you dead.
- You have to hit it in the eye 4 times. Every time you hit the eye, it will close and become invulnerable while it performs an attack. When it has only one hit left, it will always do the rotating attack. Otherwise, it will pick at random between the grid attack, the tentacle poke and the **** tentacle attack.
- **Grid attack**: Vertical and horizontal tentacles come from random positions on the borders of the screen, forming a grid, 4 times in total. You have to stay in between rows and columns of tentacles, which you can do by quickly turning in small circles using the analog stick. This attack is the best one for speed purposes, as it's one of the fastest (same duration as the tentacle poke), and ensures tentacles won't block you from hitting the eye on its first vulnerability frames.
- **Tentacle poke**: 5 tentacles come successively from a random position on the border of the screen and attack in a line towards Cable Boy. This is easy enough to avoid, just keep moving. It's as fast as the grid attack, but sometimes the last tentacle will get in your way and you'll have to wait until it disappears to hit the eye without dying. Remember that after hitting the eye, Cable Boy will be forced to the right for a while before you regain control, so make sure you won't hit the last tentacle during this forced movement.
- **&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; tentacle attack**: The bad RNG one. It wastes 10 seconds compared to a grid attack or a perfect tentacle poke. The name comes from the pattern of the attack: tentacles come successively from the border of the screen, always at the same spots and angles, drawing 4 stars that look like the * character. The best way to stay safe from this attack is to just stay over or under the eye by turning quickly in circles with the analog stick, or just holding left and mashing the cartridge action button.
- **Rotating attack**: This is the last attack, triggered when you hit the eye for the 3rd time. It is always exactly the same. Tentacles extend from the middle of the screen and rotate clockwise, then counter-clockwise. The fastest strat is to stay on the bottom-right when the attack starts. This should ensure you are right in front of the eye when it opens.
- You can get a free first hit when the fight starts, as the eye, coming from the left of the screen, is open.
- You can save some frames by clipping through the pool to get that first hit early. This is demonstrated in the videos below. All you have to do is swim out on the left of the swimming pool as soon as the screen starts locking on the pool for the boss fight. Make sure you exit the pool at about the height of the eye, and let go of any control when you're out. If all goes well, you'll hear the sound effect that confirms you hit the eye, hopefully while it's still off-screen. Once you hear the sound, you need to press the cartridge action button to start swimming in the boss arena, otherwise you'll quickly hit an off-screen glitch block. Or sometimes you'll just randomly die or won't get the hit. This is a moderate risk, low reward strat. It really isn't worth it.
- To get early hits every time the eye opens, you can face the eye, hold left and mash the cartridge action button. This will make you clip through the eye a bit. This only saves fractions of a second, but most of the time it's free.
- Sometimes (although very rarely), a random tentacle will appear and kill you. This will be fixed in the next patch.
