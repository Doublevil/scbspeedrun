  **Notes**
  - Another optimization-heavy level. Don't rush it too much at first because it's easy to die and lose a lot of time. Try to find a rhythm that you're comfortable with, and you can always come back later to try and improve it.
  - You can use the cable as shown in the video to help keep momentum or recover from a bad dash.
  - In the vertical battery section, be careful not to dash too quickly, you need to time your dashes properly so you can reach the next battery. Again, it's easy to lose a bunch of time to this section, so don't rush it.
  - You can also use one or two SD storage dashes in the vertical battery section to reach higher a bit quicker.
