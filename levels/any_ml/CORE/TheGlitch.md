[< Back (KERNELPANIC')](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/levels/any_ml/CORE/KERNELPANIC'.md) | 

**Notes**
- This is the last boss and the end of the run.
- The boss has 4 phases - one for each mandatory cartridge in the game - with a single attack for each phase, and they always follow the same order.
- It's a bit of a tough fight at first, but with some practice, it should be pretty consistent.
- Each phase follows the same pattern: execute the phase-dependent attack while forcing Cable Boy on a random cartridge, follow immediately with the black hole attack while forcing Cable Boy on the Cable cartridge, and then become vulnerable and rest for a bit while Cable Boy is forced back to the same cartridge as before the black hole.
- While the boss is vulnerable, you have to get close to the plug matching the cartridge you are forced into and stay plugged for as long as it takes to fill the plug's progress bar. Once the progress bar reaches 100%, the boss fight progresses to the next phase and the cartridge you were using can no longer be picked at random for the remainder of the fight.
- The timing on the vulnerability is pretty lenient on allowing you to reach 100% in one go, but if you mess up on your positioning during the attacks, you might have to sit through another attack/black hole phase.
- The general idea is to move to the right position (near the plug matching your cart) during the attack phase. Then when the black hole comes out you can just hook near the plug to stay put.
- Another thing to look out for is the position of the boss itself. If it strays too far away from the center during the attack, you're going to have to wait for it to slowly crawl back to the center when you're done with charging the plug.
- **Phase 1 attack**: The boss will perform 4 successive charges aimed at you. If you keep moving at angles, you're safe. Just try to prevent the boss from straying too far away from the center.
- **Phase 2 attack**: The boss spawns a lot of glitch fragments from its center at various angles. The fragments travel in a straight line and bounce off any walls they might encounter. This is a scary attack, especially since you cannot see the fragments when they are behind the boss, so you have to watch out for these and expect a fragment that went straight down into the boss to come down under it at some point.
- **Phase 3 attack**: In addition to spawning a few glitch fragments, the boss will spawn glitch tentacles charging in your direction. Waiting for the first tentacle to come out half-way to your position before moving at all should make it spawn at least one other tentacle at the same angle. Then you can just lure the rest of the tentacles out of your way. If you need to get to the other side of the room, you don't have to rush it or anything, but keep looking out for the glitch fragments that might come out of the boss while you're right over or under.
- **Phase 4 attack**: In addition to spawning a few glitch fragments, the boss will aim a deadly laser at you and will rotate to keep slowly following you as you're avoiding it. If your last cartridge is the ink cart, you can toggle the ink and just hold onto the alternate dimension wall that's right next to the ink plug. The wall will protect you from the laser and you just have to wait there. For any other cartridge, you're going to want to kind of circle around the boss. The attack stops after following you around in a semi-circle or so, so don't go overboard and try to make a full circle or more. If you do, you're going to be in a bad spot when the black hole comes out.
