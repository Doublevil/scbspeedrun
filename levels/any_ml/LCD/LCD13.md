  **Notes**
  - This strat uses a Wall Plug. Learn more in the Cable Cart techs page.
  - The platforming part is a bit tricky and involves a pretty precise ink double jump.
  - The wall plug part is not an easy one either and may fail if your timing or grabbing point isn't ideal.
  - To make the wall plug work, grab right under it, then dash upwards immediately, before the cable shrinks (make sure you haven't used up your dash before!)

  **Notes**
  - This is barely faster than the other strat, which is considerably easier. Only do this one if you are feeling crazy.
  - If you hesitate or lose any time anywhere, the other strat is faster.

## Strat

`Time` **00:07.000** `Difficulty` ★★☆☆☆

  **Notes**
  - Despite being very fast, it's probably the easiest way to do this level fast. It might take a bit of practice to chain all this together, but it's very consistent.
  - The low dash at the end might seem scary but it's actually safer than making a full jump, as you're falling more slowly. It's still faster than a full jump too.
  - Especially with speedhack, you'll have to remember to quickly toggle the ink cart at the start.

  **Notes**
  - You can rest on the alt-ink platform instead of jump-inking in the middle section, it shouldn't cost too much time.
