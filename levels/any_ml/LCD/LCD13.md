  **Notes**
  - This is barely faster than the other strat, which is considerably easier. Only do this one if you are feeling crazy.
  - If you hesitate or lose any time anywhere, the other strat is faster.

## Strat

  **Notes**
  - Despite being very fast, it's probably the easiest way to do this level fast. It might take a bit of practice to chain all this together, but it's very consistent.
  - The low dash at the end might seem scary but it's actually safer than making a full jump, as you're falling more slowly. It's still faster than a full jump too.
  - Especially with speedhack, you'll have to remember to quickly toggle the ink cart at the start.
