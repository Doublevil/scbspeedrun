  **Notes**
  - Remember to cancel your jumps when you don't need full height.
  - The wall jumps over the glitch blocks on the left wall look scary... and they are. You have to time your wall jumps right to make it past them. This is what makes it a difficult strat.
  - The first glitch block wall jump is pretty consistent and easy to get. For the second one, you'll have to really think about how to adjust your jump height and it might not be worth going for it.
  - Outside the tower, make sure to get the jumps across the gaps early or you'll have to stop your horizontal momentum.

  **Notes**
  - Inside the tower, canceling jumps saves quite a bit of time.
  - Outside the tower, make sure to get the jumps across the gaps early or you'll have to stop your horizontal momentum.
