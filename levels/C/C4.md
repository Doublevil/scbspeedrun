  **Notes**
  - This can be used as a backup to recover from failing the cloud bonk strat in some cases.
  - The timing to get the wall jump on the side of the cloud seems to vary wildly and can be pretty precise at times, so make sure you buffer it right before touching the cloud.

  **Notes**
  - This is very precise. If you go too far to the left, you can go for the Cloud hug strat as a backup and it might still save over a second. If you fail it any other way, you die.
