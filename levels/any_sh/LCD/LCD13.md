  **Notes**
  - Despite being the fastest we've found, it's probably the easiest way to do this level fast. It might take a bit of practice to chain all this together, but it's very consistent.
  - The low dash at the end might seem scary but it's actually safer than making a full jump, as you're falling more slowly. It's still faster than a full jump too.
  - Especially with speedhack, you'll have to remember to quickly toggle the ink cart at the start.
