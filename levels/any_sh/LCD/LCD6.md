  **Notes**
  - It's very fast and impressive, but not very consistent. It's better to go for the other strat.
  - It's even harder and inconsistent and less worth going for it with the speedhack.

  **Notes**
  - If you are running into the alt ink platform after the second dash-double-jump, you're probably double-jumping on dashing too early after the wall run. Try to make sure your jumps are timed to get a lot of height.

  **Notes**
  - The second wall run on the alt ink platform isn't very consistent. It shouldn't lose you much time at all though if you don't get it. Just double-jump and dash up.
