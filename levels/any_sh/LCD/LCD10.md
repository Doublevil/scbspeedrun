  **Notes**
  - This one is crazy precise.
  - You might want to do the platforming normally at the start instead of the quick ink/dash action. What saves the most time is falling around the corners instead of jumping.
  - It's a pretty long level. Dying here would lose you a lot of time. Consider the safer strat.

  **Notes**
  - Doing this level fast might give you some trouble at first. This is just memorization. There is almost nothing you have to react to.
  - The speedhack makes things a bit harder, as you have to be careful not to jump over the ink platforms entirely.
