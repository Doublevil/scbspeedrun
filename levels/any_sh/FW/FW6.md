  **Notes**
  - Obviously you don't have to take that shortcut at the start, it barely saves a second.

  **Notes**
  - This strat uses SD Storage. You can learn more about it in the "Jump cart techs" section of this guide.
  - It's exactly as fast as the other strat, but have you seen how cool it is?!
  - Also, it's as hard as it gets to get enough jumps to reach the goal.
  - The name comes from Bobson's commentary in RTA in Japan Summer 2021.

  **Notes**
  - Both onigiris are pretty difficult ones. Prepare to die.
  - Don't rush it on the cable path near the end. Make sure you know exactly what to do in case your jumps don't go as planned.
  - Near the end, worst come worst, you can recover from a mistake by switching to voltage or jump cart and grabbing back the cable onigiri with a swap dash/jump.
  - Keep in mind that this is a long level.
