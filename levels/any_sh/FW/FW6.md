  **Notes**

  **Notes**
  - This strat uses SD Storage. You can learn more about it in the "Jump cart techs" section of this guide.
  - It's exactly as fast as the other strat, but have you seen how cool it is?!
  - Also, it's as hard as it gets to get enough jumps to reach the goal.
  - The name comes from Bobson's commentary in RTA in Japan Summer 2021.
