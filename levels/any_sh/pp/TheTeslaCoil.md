**Notes**
- Barring the near-impossible skip, this is by far the easiest and most boring boss fight of the game. No, the Disassembler doesn't count.
- The Tesla Coil is invulnerable at first and will pick one of 3 attacks at random. Once it's done, it will remove its electric barrier for a moment.
- Once the barrier is down, we can repeatedly dash into the glass dome to break it ridiculously fast. Just make sure to dash from above or from the side.
- When the dome is broken, the Tesla Coil enters a second phase, where it's invulnerable again and will always do the same attack (the 3 spinning electric rays).
- When its phase 2 attack is over, after a bit more than a second, the bulb will become vulnerable and a dash will finish the boss.
- The RNG here can make you save or lose up to about 8 seconds, depending on which attack you get.

  **Notes**
  - This is so inconsistent that it can be considered a TAS-only strat. You can ignore this and go for the standard boss fight strats.
  - This is so inconsistent that the demonstration video took over an hour to record and still is very far from an ideal execution.
  - The first part is a zip using the closing door to push us up and to the left. The zip is both *extremely* precise and random (we are forcing the physics engine to push us out in a random direction).
  - There are no setups for this. Note that it seems way more consistent when starting the jumps from as close as possible to the edge of the trigger, and using the directional stick.
  - Double jump in quick succession, then move right for a couple frames and immediately dash upwards and slightly to the left.
  - Because the trigger that closes the door is the same that also locks the camera, we have to make our way to the goal with the camera locked on the boss room. It can be very tricky, as the decorations around the room are arranged in spirals and other shapes that you can get stuck on.
  - Use the Cartridge select menu to see where you are. Don't overuse it, or you'll end up wasting time instead of saving time.
  - The final move is a wall plug: from just below the goal, grab the ceiling with the cable cart, wait a bit for the cable to stretch back to normal, then switch to the jump cart. This should grab the goal.
  - It's easier to practice the second part in the level editor, so that you can learn to navigate in the level without having the camera locked to the boss room.
