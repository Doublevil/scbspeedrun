# Any% Speedhack > The Core > CORE8

[< Back (CORE7)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/levels/any_sh/CORE/CORE7.md) | [Next (CORE9) >](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/levels/any_sh/CORE/CORE9.md)

**Notes**
- Because the Core levels are so long and quite difficult, and also are the end of the run, you generally should try to reduce risk instead of optimizing speed. On these levels, trying to save 3 seconds can quickly end up costing you 30 seconds and killing your run.

  **Notes**
  - Very risky as a whole, but you can use only parts of the strat to improve your time a little bit.
  - Using the jump cart in the middle section allows us to skip having to go up and hug some wall to refresh the voltage cart. It shouldn't be too risky as long as you use the dash early.
