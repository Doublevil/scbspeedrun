# Liquid Crystal Dimension > TheQuartzCrystal

**Notes**
- This is a boss fight. It's very RNG-dependant, and pretty dangerous too, as it's a pretty long fight.
- With a bit of practice, you'll learn how to stay safe from its attacks. Basically, be always ready to toggle the ink cartridge, and don't overestimate the time it takes for its laser to actually come out when it switches dimension.
- Let's call the 4 items we have to pick up "prisms".
- There's a 50/50 chance to get a prism in the normal dimension, which allows you to switch to the jump cart and almost instantly take a hit on the boss. This is why this boss is so RNG-heavy.
- A bit of Bernoulli probability calculus tells us there is a 6.25% chance of getting either best or worst RNG. The most probable outcome is 2 prisms in each dimension, with a 37.5% chance. Only one bad or only one good are both 25% chance.

## Good RNG

`Time` **00:45.000** `Difficulty` ★★☆☆☆

  **Notes**
  - This is what happens when you get all 4 prisms in the normal dimension.
