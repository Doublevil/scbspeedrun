  **Notes**
  - You don't have to do the wall clip on the first jump, but it saves a bit of time. If you go for it, make sure to jump out of the wall right after switching to triple jump. This counts as a normal jump (as if you were jumping off the ground, i.e. not a double-jump), and will allow you to avoid the glitch blocks.

## Crazy wall clip strat

  **Notes**
  - This one is just insane.
  - There are 2 wall clips in that strat (the one on the first jump and the ceiling one).
  - The idea is to regen the dashes to be able to skip part of the level.
  - The ceiling wall clip is completely unreliable.
  - Please don't try this at home.

## I-hate-ink strat

  **Notes**
  - If you have trouble getting your ink toggles right and you don't want to practice, you can always fallback to this strat. It's very safe but also very slow.
