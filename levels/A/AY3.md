  **Notes**
  - Requires a lot of practice to master.
  - One of the keys to master it to grab the second platform before it gets too close, which makes the jump from that platform much more lenient, as overshooting it won't crash you into the last glitch block.
  - You might find that holding right just a little bit before the first platform reaches the glitch blocks gives you the right timing to keep going without hitting glitch blocks and to grab the second platform with the right timing.
