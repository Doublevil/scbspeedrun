  **Notes**
  - Hardest strat in the game. Take your time, don't go as fast as the video.
  - Don't hesitate too much either, as overthinking will lead to death, and death is more costly if you spent time idling.
  - If you're not confident on the last onigiri, collect the first 2 and finish the level first. You might lose less time working on that 3rd one if you don't have to collect everything every time. See the 100% route "Optimized strat" to help you with that.
  - The techniques used in this strat are all fast, but reasonable.
  - For instance, the forward-reverse dash on the first onigiri looks crazy hard, but the alternatives would be at least equally insane.
  - Similarly, the last section is done with voltage cart because it's both fast and relatively consistent, when compared with alternative strategies.
  - The first voltage after grabbing the last onigiri will always clear that wall jump obstacle when done exactly in this way. Always start at the back wall of the onigiri room, and flick up at the center of the passageway. If you flick up too early (grazing the left glitch wall), you will hit the ceiling; zigzag just a little bit to save it. If you flick up too late (grazing the right glitch wall), you won't clear the obstacle; you'll need to clear it normally with a wall jump, use voltage again, or use triple jump to get to the other side.
