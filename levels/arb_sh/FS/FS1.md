  **Notes**
  - Consider the safer strat. It's hard enough already.
  - The differences with the safer strat here are the following:
  - In the voltage pool part, we immediately progress further into the level after picking up the onigiri, with very fast voltage flicks.
  - In the second onigiri section, we don't stop to wait for the batteries to regenerate, meaning we have to resort to a very dangerous canceled double-jump.

## Double onigiri safer strat

  **Notes**
  - More reasonable than the risky strat.
  - For the first onigiri, you need to start your voltage while grazing the glitch wall on the right so that you pick up the onigiri without changing direction. Then flick back up. It's very hard to continue to the right just after picking up the onigiri there so we do it in two times in this strat.
  - For the horizontal battery section, a hint for the 100% route was to use the analog stick instead of the D-pad or keyboard, but it's not recommended for this strat because of the onigiri section, which has sharp turns, making it hard to adjust with the stick.
  - Take it slowly in the onigiri section so that the batteries can regenerate.
