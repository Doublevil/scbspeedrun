  **Notes**
  - Considerably faster but also way more difficult than the safer strat.
  - The video rushes almost every grab and jump, but it should be more consistent if you take it a bit slower.
  - Resting on the platform in the middle of the maze makes the next section more consistent.
  - After the platform, you have to reach a certain height at every jump in order to grab the next block. It is advised to hold Up for a while before jumping so that you're certain to clear it.
  - Try to stabilize early when going down the gap between the glitch blocks.
