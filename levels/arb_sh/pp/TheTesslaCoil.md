**Notes**
- This is by far the easiest and most boring boss fight of the game. No, the Disassembler doesn't count.
- The Tessla Coil is invulnerable at first and will pick one of 3 attacks at random. Once it's done, it will remove its electric barrier for a moment.
- Once the barrier is down, we can repeatedly dash into the glass dome to break it ridiculously fast. Just make sure to dash from above or from the side.
- When the dome is broken, the Tessla Coil enters a second phase, where it's invulnerable again and will always do the same attack (the 3 spinning electric rays).
- When its phase 2 attack is over, after a bit more than a second, the bulb will become vulnerable and a dash will finish the boss.
- The RNG here can make you save or lose up to about 8 seconds, depending on which attack you get.
