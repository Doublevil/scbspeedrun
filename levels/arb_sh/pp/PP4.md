  **Notes**
  - The jump in the tiny gap to grab the second onigiri is obviously hard. Below are some advices to make it more consistent.
  - The key is to get enough height on the previous jump. If you are just under the 4th floating block when grabbing it, you should get the perfect jump every time.
  - In order to reach that height consistently, the video proposes a decent setup. Don't jump on the first hook, just fall and grab. Then high jump out of it and grab the far end of the 3rd floating block, then high jump out of it late enough that you almost bump into the 4th floating block.
  - You can probably find your own different setup if you don't like that one.
  - If it seems like you aren't high enough when grabbing the 4th floating block, don't go for it anyways, you won't make it. What you can do as a backup is grab the pillar just above the 2 glitch blocks, as low as possible, then wait for the cable to stabilize straight down, and do a normal jump into the gap.
