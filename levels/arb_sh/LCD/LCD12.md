  **Notes**
  - This strat uses SD Storage. You can learn more about it in the "Jump cart techs" section of this guide.
  - It's not very visible, but the SD storage is performed just after dropping the onigiri. It is used to pick the onigiri back up, while gaining just enough height to make it to the vertical ink platform above.
  - This is all very precise. It takes lots of training to both place the onigiri just right, and perform the SD storage well enough to get enough height to reach the platform.
  - The SD storage must be extremely short, or you won't have enough dash left to reach the vertical ink platform.

  **Notes**
  - This strat uses SD Storage. You can learn more about it in the "Jump cart techs" section of this guide.
  - This is a safer alternative to the Onigiri SD storage strat.
  - Instead of grabbing the ink platform above the glitchy ink, we grab in on the other side. This is slower but it's way easier to reach. It doesn't require a particularly precise SD storage.
