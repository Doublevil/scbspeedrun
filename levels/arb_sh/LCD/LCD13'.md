  **Notes**
  - This strat uses the wall plug tech. See the Cable cart techs page for more info.
  - You have to position the onigiri as high as possible, which is why we jump so late before running up the glitchy ink wall.
  - The wall plug is a complex one, because the goal is pretty far away from the wall. This means we have to extend the cable somehow. We do that by grabbing the ceiling as early as possible. Then, we exploit the vertical momentum of the speedhack wall run to push the cable further up and reach the goal before it shrinks down, while switching back to ink cart to grab the onigiri back.
  - This strat definitely takes some training to get consistently, and it might seem impossible at first, but it can absolutely be consistent once you get how it works.

## Speedhack jailbreak intended strat

  **Notes**
  - Be careful on the jump from the top of the wall, that's an edge coyote. We first detach, then a bit later press Jump. Don't jump too late either, because you don't want to land on top of the glitch block, but on its side.
  - If you can't get the edge coyote consistently, land on top of the huge wall and jump from there.
