  **Notes**
  - One of the hardest strats in the guide. This feels like chaining 3 risky strats together in a single level.
  - Consider the safer strat, or at least mixing in some elements of the safer strat.
  - In the first part, the aim is to maximize our running speed by using quick ink toggles, and low jumps when we cannot directly double-ink through. There's a deceptive rhythm to it, but you should mostly react visually to know when to toggle ink. Toggle just before running into the walls, every time. You still need to get the sequence right: ink, jump, jump, ink, jump. The last jump isn't technically necessary, but it makes things more consistent.
  - The second part consists in running on the platforms as much as possible to get the speedhack speed. On the last jump, the key to optimize it is to make sure you'll cover enough horizontal distance to be able to toggle ink and fall through immediately, without touching the ink platform.
  - The third part is very hard timing-wise. The reasonable thing to do would be to stabilize a bit on a wall before going down the onigiri maze, rather than just free falling.
