# All Onigiris Speedhack > The Core > CORE5

[< Back (CORE4)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/levels/arb_sh/CORE/CORE4.md) | [Next (CORE6) >](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/levels/arb_sh/CORE/CORE6.md)

**Notes**
- Because the Core levels are so long and quite difficult, and also are the end of the run, you generally should try to reduce risk instead of optimizing speed. On these levels, trying to save 3 seconds can quickly end up costing you 30 seconds and killing your run.

  **Notes**
  - Based on the optimized strat from the Any% route.
  - The onigiri part isn't too hard once you understand how to complete it.
  - The video skips the first ink wall by simply jumping to the second wall directly. This makes it harder though. To make things easier, it's advised to wall jump on the first wall instead.
  - We also skip the last wall on the way out by switching to voltage cart. This one shouldn't be an issue.
  - You can easily train on the onigiri part by loading the level in the level editor and setting a checkpoint on the platform just before the ink maze.
