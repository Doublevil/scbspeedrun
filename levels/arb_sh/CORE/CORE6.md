# All Onigiris Speedhack > The Core > CORE6

[< Back (CORE5)](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/levels/arb_sh/CORE/CORE5.md) | [Next (CORE7) >](https://github.com/Doublevil/scbspeedrun/blob/main/levels/arb_sh/CORE/CORE7.md)

**Notes**
- Because the Core levels are so long and quite difficult, and also are the end of the run, you generally should try to reduce risk instead of optimizing speed. On these levels, trying to save 3 seconds can quickly end up costing you 30 seconds and killing your run.

  **Notes**
  - The cable part is hard, but you can use triple jump to save a bad jump or make a jump easier, as seen in the video. If you need to, you can easily touch any of the walls to reset your dash and jump.
  - We use voltage to go past the goal without connecting to it. Be very careful with the cable, as it's easy to accidentally grab the goal from below, even when it's too far away to appear on the screen. Make sure there's no direct line to the goal when using the cable near the end.
