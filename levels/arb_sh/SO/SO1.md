  **Notes**
  - There's not much we can do here in term of techs. Fortunately, speedhack does makes this onigiri both faster and easier.
  - You can run up the walls, but that doesn't mean you always should. Note how we alternate between running up walls and normal wall jumps to be as fast as possible.
  - Speedhack makes it hard to position just right for the precise wall jump part. There's no real technique for that, just tap Right and Left until you're good.
  - To get the wall jump on the single wall block consistently, wall jump during the jump rather than while falling after the jump. It's not only faster, but also easier. You need to touch the wall block, as high as possible, just under the glitch, by lightly tapping Left, then start holding Right, and after a few frames, press Jump. If you press Jump early, you won't make it.
  - Download the video and do a frame-by-frame on the hard parts if you have difficulties with this one. And practice a lot.
