  **Notes**
  - Probably the hardest onigiri in terms of death count. But fortunately, the only hard part comes first.
  - The most reliable way we have found to make it past that gap is to use the cable cart to grab the wall at a very precise point (almost pixel perfect) so that the cable extends just enough to be able to lean forward to the other side, so that a cable jump will barely take us to the other side.
  - You will die a lot in there, and it's okay. It's pretty fast anyways.
  - If you find yourself just short of making it under the blocks, you can try to wiggle the cable. Sometimes it will get you under there.
  - Once we're past, we perform an optional Metaphor zip (see movement techs) as a minor time save. You can go around instead.
  - Hold Down and Right in the crumbling blocks section to make sure you grab the bottom-most one.
