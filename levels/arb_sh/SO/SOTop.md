  **Notes**
  - We skip the cutscene by going to the right instead of the left.
  - The floating onigiri are the onigiri you collected in your save. You could think that they allow you to climb up to the Free Space exit, but with the voltage cart, you don't actually need any.
  - Depending on how many onigiri you collected, you might take a penalty by them blocking your way, or getting nice dash or voltage refreshes out of them and ending up going faster.
