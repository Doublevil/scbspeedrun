  **Notes**
  - On the first part, we run up the first wall and detach without jumping, then run up but this time perform a wall jump for the second one.
  - After reaching the first crumbling block, you can run up the walls (just hold Left and Up) for the two sprite block towers, but then for the crumbling block, you'll have to stop running up, and do a normal wall jump from low enough on the block that you don't bump into the glitch blocks above. If you grab the crumbling block too high, wait a bit before wall jumping.
  - In the middle section, we just cheat our way through by juggling the onigiri with a cable jump (cable jumping and immediately switching back to null cart to pick the onigiri back up). It's way easier to execute than the intended path, and saves a lot of time.
  - With speedhack, the last jump can be tricky, because it's easy to run so fast that you end up on the glitch blocks before jumping. Keep in mind that you have to jump early! If you want to take it safer, you can do another cable jump juggle here instead of a normal jump.

  **Notes**
  - An alternative, unintended onigiri route to the goal.
  - With speedhack, it can be almost as fast as the regular strat, but it's also way harder.
  - Go for the regular strat, this one is not worth it, even if you play it safer.
  - Going under the tower with the onigiri requires the use of either an edge coyote as shown in the strat, or a cable jump juggle, which would be slower but safer.
  - We use another variant of edge coyote 2 times to jump over the glitch blocks on the wall super fast and without switching out of null cart (run up the wall, detach, wait a bit, then jump in the air).
  - The jump and juggle that takes us under the goal is pretty tough to execute, you'll mostly end up bumping into the glitch blocks on the ceiling. You have to run up the wall for only a few frames, then hold Left. Don't switch to jump cart too early, or you won't be able to grab the wall under the goal.
  - Once we are under the goal, we use wall plug (see the cable strats page for more info) to grab the goal through the ceiling.
