  **Notes**
  - We start with a cable jump onigiri juggle to grab the onigiri while skipping a few wall jumps, and also extend the cable to grab the goal earlier at the end.
  - Crossing the crumbling walls with speedhack is hard, you need to calibrate it just right so that you don't run into the glitch blocks but can still jump on the other side.
  - In the next part, calibrating your wall jump to clear the gap without touching the top or bottom glitch blocks is the hardest part of the level. Train a bit on this until you get a hang of it. It's advised to spend a bit of time calibrating your height there before making the jump, that will cost you less time than dying.
  - In this same part, we skip one of the two walls, using a speedhack wall run with an edge coyote jump. It's not advised, because it makes things quite harder and doesn't save that much time.
  - The last part looks scary but it's just a coyote jump, it shouldn't be too hard, especially with speedhack. If you really want to play it safe, you can use a cable jump juggle, but it's not recommended.
  - After the coyote jump in the end, if your cable is long enough (as it should be due to the cable jump juggle at the start), it should plug into the goal by itself. This is possible because null cart keeps cable length.
