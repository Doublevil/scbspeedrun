  **Notes**
  - If you miss any laser cycle, you'll have to improvise or die. When missing early on, you're probably better off hitting a glitch to reset everything, rather than try to improvise with the cycles and probably die anyways.
  - At the start, it's easier to line up for voltage cart after doing a neutral jump, because the speedhack would make us run into the glitch block to the left otherwise.
  - About the horizontal laser cycle timing: if you make it to the same cycle as the strat, note that it will stop firing the moment the rotating laser behind you hits the block you're waiting on. It's very lenient though, especially with speedhack. You don't have to rush it.
