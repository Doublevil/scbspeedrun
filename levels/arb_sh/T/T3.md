  **Notes**
  - This strat uses an edge coyote (coyote timed wall jump) to grab the onigiri without falling down.
  - The long jump from the left crumbling wall into the onigiri pit is a bit scary, but definitely saves a bit of time compared to cutting it in several jumps. If you are having trouble with this jump, make sure you let go of the wall (press Right) for a couple of frames BEFORE jumping. And don't jump from too far up, or you'll fall too fast.
