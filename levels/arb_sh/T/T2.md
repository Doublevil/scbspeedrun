  **Notes**
  - There are several optimizations here, but you can easily tweak the strat to something you're more comfortable with.
  - We only use the right crumbling block path to get the onigiri, which is normally intended as an exit only. The left path is slower.
  - After landing on the lowest crumbling block, you can reach the onigiri platform with one coyote jump as demonstrated here. It's way safer and only a little bit slower to do 2 jumps here.
