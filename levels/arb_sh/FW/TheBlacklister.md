# All Onigiris Speedhack > The Firewall > TheBlacklister

**Notes**
- This is a boss fight. The Blacklister is a big eye with glitchy tentacles and wants you dead.
- You have to hit it in the eye 4 times. Every time you hit the eye, it will close and become invulnerable while it performs an attack. When it has only one hit left, it will always do the rotating attack. Otherwise, it will pick at random between the grid attack, the tentacle poke and the **** tentacle attack.
- **Grid attack**: Vertical and horizontal tentacles come from random positions on the borders of the screen, forming a grid, 4 times in total. You have to stay in between rows and columns of tentacles, which you can do by quickly turning in small circles using the analog stick. This attack is the best one for speed purposes, as it's one of the fastest (same duration as the tentacle poke), and ensures tentacles won't block you from hitting the eye on its first vulnerability frames.
- **Tentacle poke**: 5 tentacles come successively from a random position on the border of the screen and attack in a line towards Cable Boy. This is easy enough to avoid, just keep moving. It's as fast as the grid attack, but sometimes the last tentacle will get in your way and you'll have to wait until it disappears to hit the eye without dying. Remember that after hitting the eye, Cable Boy will be forced to the right. You can cancel this movement by pressing the cartridge action button while inputting the direction you want, but be careful not to hit the last tentacle on your way out.
- **&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; tentacle attack**: The bad RNG one. It wastes 10 seconds compared to a grid attack or a perfect tentacle poke. The name comes from the pattern of the attack: tentacles come successively from the border of the screen, always at the same spots and angles, drawing 4 stars that look like the * character. The best way to stay safe from this attack is to just stay over or under the eye by turning quickly in circles with the analog stick, or just holding left and mashing the cartridge action button.
- **Rotating attack**: This is the last attack, triggered when you hit the eye for the 3rd time. It is always exactly the same. Tentacles extend from the middle of the screen and rotate clockwise, then counter-clockwise. The fastest strat is to stay on the bottom-right when the attack starts. This should ensure you are right in front of the eye when it opens.
- You can get a free first hit when the fight starts, as the eye, coming from the left of the screen, is open.
- To get early hits every time the eye opens, you can face the eye, hold left and mash the cartridge action button. This will make you clip through the eye a bit. This only saves fractions of a second, but most of the time it's free.
