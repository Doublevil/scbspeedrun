  **Notes**
  - Both onigiris are pretty difficult ones. Prepare to die.
  - Don't rush it on the cable path near the end. Make sure you know exactly what to do in case your jumps don't go as planned.
  - Near the end, worst come worst, you can recover from a mistake by switching to voltage or jump cart and grabbing back the cable onigiri with a swap dash/jump.
  - Keep in mind that this is a long level.
