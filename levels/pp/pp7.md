  **Notes**
  - The corner boost is required but isn't very reliable at all. If you miss it (it should be obvious and leave you ample time to react), you can fallback to the casual strat.

  **Notes**
  - This is almost the same as the dash boost strat, it still works with a corner boost. It's a bit more consistent and almost as fast, but it's less obvious to see if you are going to get it or if you should fallback to the casual strat.

  **Notes**
  - This strat can be used as a fallback if you miss the corner boost to fly over the glitch labyrinth.
