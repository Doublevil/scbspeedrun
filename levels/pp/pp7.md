  **Notes**: Getting the corner boost here that allows you to fly over the whole glitch labyrinth isn't very consistent, but it's not risky - if you don't get it, just fallback to the backup (casual) strat.

  ## Grapple boost
  `Time` **00:08.500**
  `Difficulty` ★★★☆☆

  **Notes**: This is basically the same idea as the Dash boost, but the grapple makes it just a little bit more consistent. Once again, if your jump around the corner doesn't look like it's high enough, fallback to the backup (casual) strat.

  **Notes**: Casual strat. Use this as a backup if you fail the dash or grapple boost.
