  **Notes**
  - You can use the hook as shown in the video to help keep momentum or recover from a bad dash.
  - In the vertical battery section, be careful not to dash too quickly, you need to time your dashes properly so you can reach the next battery. It's easy to lose a bunch of time to this section.
